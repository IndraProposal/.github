Indra Proposal is an exploration into the fascinating world of quantum mechanics, celestial bodies, and the intriguing parallels they share

### **1. README.md:**
   - **Project Overview:**

   > Welcome to Indra Proposal, a project that aims to create a quantum fractal universe of mind, where everything is connected and conscious. This project is inspired by Mindrock, a philosophical framework that explores the nature of reality, consciousness, and creativity. Indra Proposal is an attempt to implement Mindrock's principles using quantum mechanics, artificial intelligence, and literature.
