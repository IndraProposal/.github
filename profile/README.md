## Introduction

Welcome to the IndraProposal GitHub organization! We are a collective of researchers, developers, and enthusiasts focused on exploring the applications of quantum mechanics in various domains, including artificial intelligence, n-body problem simulations, and planetary identification.

## Mission

Our mission is to advance the field of quantum computing and its applications by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and open-source development.

## Projects

Here are some of our key projects:

- **ChitAkasha**: A quantum computing framework for n-body problem simulations.
- **Fractal Compression Algorithm**: An innovative algorithm for data compression using fractal patterns.
- **Quantum Planet Identification**: A project aimed at identifying planets through quantum behavior.
